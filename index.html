                <h2>I am a student from Skövde, Sweden but...</h2>
                <p>I have lived and moved across the world. 
                At a very young age me and my family moved to Beijing, China and lived there for a while before we moved back to Sweden for a while until we flew down to the small rocky island called Malta. 
                On Malta we lived in Sliema for 1 and half years before it was time to move again, this time it was back to Asia. 
                We flew down to the island nation called the Philippines and lived in the capital, Manila where I studied in the British School of Manila for 3 years.
                After my time in Manila it was time to move back to Sweden after having travled arround the world for a copule of years and having experienced a veriety of cultures and places.
                My time living across the globe has taught me many important lessons and given me the oportunity to speak fluent english</p>

                <h2>I have learned a bunch of diffrent tools and languages & My coding journey</h2>
                <p>I like learning and that is no to no extent limited programming languages, I love learning a new language when I want to achieve a new task. 
                   But it all started with HTML & CSS (yes, I hear you "html and css arent languages ):<", weeelll HTML combined with CSS is turing complete so take that how you will) on an old school laptop where i wanted to make my first web page.
                   I got some simple red text up and running but couldnt quite figure out how to share it so I gave up on coding for a while, until I found my way back.<br/><br/>
                   I heard of a language called "Javascript", its quite popular now a days but at the time it was everything I wanted and more, the ability to easily create interactive content blew my mind.
                   Gone were the days of static sites, everything needed to be interactive, the title? yep, that's interactive.<br/>
                   I continued scripting in this cool little language until I found a small chat platform called "discord", yeah, I think its pretty small.
                   Either way through discord I saw these bots and thought to myself, how in the world are these made?
                   So I found out, me and my friend came in with big ambitions and put together a bot with what little we knew and from that Node JS quickly become my favourite "language".<br/><br/>
                   But I felt like my games, so then I found this small, new and undiscovered game engine called "Unity" and tried my best to wrap my small head around C# and got it working decently well, made my self a cookie clicker clone.
                   But unity, no, that was too slow, I wanna go fast, whats the fastest language I know?
                   Hmm, I think I remember hearing about this brand new language called C++, that sounds fast so I tried learning SDL2 and sort of did it, with the help of Bjarne Sourstoups a tour of C++ and a few too many headaches.<br/>
                   But C++, that's old, I like new, I want to be at the forefront of tech so I jumped ships to Rust, but ultimatley gave up on that, but I will not stand defeated for long, Rust is on my list too learn this year.
                   After my faliure to pick up Rust I instead jumped to Go and made a simple http server before I fell back in love with Node JS again.
                   Go is also on my to learn list for this and next year.<br/>
                   Messing arround in Node has now lead me too believe that I need to make my own languages, ladies and gents its time for Basil&#8482</p>
