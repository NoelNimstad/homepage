                <h2>I am a student from Sk√∂vde, Sweden but...</h2>
                <p>I have lived and moved across the world. 
                At a very young age me and my family moved to Beijing, China and lived there for a while before we moved back to Sweden for a while until we flew down to the small rocky island called Malta. 
                On Malta we lived in Sliema for 1 and half years before it was time to move again, this time it was back to Asia. 
                We flew down to the island nation called the Philippines and lived in the capital, Manila where i studied in the British School of Manila for 3 years.
                After my time in Manila it was time to move back to Sweden after having travaled on vacations arround the world experiencing a veriety of cultures and landscapes
                My time living across the globe has taught me many important lessons and given me the oportunity to speak fluent english</p>
